I’m Spencer. Last Summer I made the decision to drop out of College. I studied Computer Science, Business, and Entrepreneurship and was doing quite well. But none of it really had me interested, I felt the best way to learn was to go out and learn by doing.

So I decided to take a leap. Over the last few months I’ve been building custom web applications for new technology startups. I love that work - it’s challenging and rewarding.

I’ve lived different places among Columbus and, previously, Cincinnati. I’m a huge supporter of small businesses. The personalized touch the owners and employees give to the work they do draw me to them... and I love that I’m supporting the local community.

To find new businesses I search for what I’m looking for on Google and go to the places that show up on Google. It’s the fastest and most convenient way for me to find somewhere to do business.

But I feel like I’m missing some amazing businesses in the area. And so are the other people moving to Columbus as the city continues to grow.

So, my mission with Handlebar Labs is to help the growing community find and do business with the hundreds of small and locally owned businesses in the city and surrounding communities.

### Who am I?

As previously stated I used to go to Ohio State University but after 4 semesters I still didn’t feel College was the right avenue for me. I felt that I was being held back from my fullest potential while I was there. Since making the choice to leave school I’ve immersed myself in small businesses learning as much as I can.

### So, what does Handlebar Labs actually do?</h3>

I help small businesses use the web to their advantage. I’m here to provide websites that work for them. They aren't the flashiest or the most expensive. I have a few principles that drive the way I build a website:
