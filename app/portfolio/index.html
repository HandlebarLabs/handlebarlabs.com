          Spencer Carli was a great asset to me in building my organization’s brand. His web design process was completely seamless from beginning to end. I am so grateful that he was patient with me! I don’t consider myself creative at all so it was hard for me to articulate my vision. But he took it and ran with it! He kept communication with me the entire time and made sure I understood how to navigate through WordPress. Spencer has gained a new fan and I will refer all my business contacts to him for their web design needs!
