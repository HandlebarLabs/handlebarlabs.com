React Native School teaches beginner to intermediate React Native concepts online via free tutorials and private courses.

Started in late 2018 as a followup to a [growing library of React Native courses](/projects) that we had created over the prior ~2 years.

It's a monthly or yearly subscription to become a member and consists of three main components:

1. Free tutorials ([written](https://www.reactnativeschool.com/tutorials) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/ReactNativeSchool))
2. [Paid courses](https://www.reactnativeschool.com/classes)
3. Private Slack Based Community

## Marketing

To date React Native School's main source of traffic and enrollment is through content marketing.

Help people solve common problems and give them how-to templates to start implementing features -> join the email list -> continued value add over time with a pitch for React Native School in each email.

We've also created a [comprehensive free course](https://www.reactnativebasics.com/) teaching students how to build a React Native app from start to finish. This has been the source of a large number of enrollments.
