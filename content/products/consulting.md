Building things with software is fun and working with people who have cool ideas is especially fun!

We provide full stack development which provides everything on the technical side, except design.

Services include mobile, web, and backend development.

## Who We Work With

Handlebar Labs works with people/companies that use technology to solve a problem in the "real world" where the success of an app isn't measured in how long someone spends using the app but by how much value it provides to them.

We want to help a small business improve their customer service processes so they can focus on what they want to be doing daily.

We want to help a local plumbing business better manage their fleet.

We want to put the necessary information into the hands of medical professionals so they can do what they do best faster and more accurately.

If this sounds like you then we'd [love to chat](mailto:hello@handlebarlabs.com).

## Projects

Since 2014 we've worked on a variety of projects but in the last few years we've found it best to focus on long term relationships (since software is never complete). With that we've spent a few years working with [Spectrum](https://spectrum.app/) to help healthcare organizations communicate the latest guidance to their providers.

We were also heavily involved in development of the official Olympics app for the [PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games](https://twitter.com/spencer_carli/status/962147322745491457).
