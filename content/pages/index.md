<!-- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Handlebar Labs.

We've been building software and information products (for clients and internally) since 2014.

Below you can find what we're currently working on and a full archive on the [projects page](/projects). -->

<!-- Software development is a learned skill.

But once you learn it you canâ€™t just do the same thing over and over again.

**The tools may be the same but the problems are unique.**

The solutions are unique.

You need to learn how to solve the problem using the tools at your disposal.

Handlebar Labsâ€™ mission is to teach you tools, techniques, and frameworks in a way that you can confidently use them to solve the unique problems you will run into.

**We want to help you avoid getting stuck in the tutorial trap.**

So many of us have been in the situation where everything made sense in the tutorial but as soon as you step out to solve a different problem... your mind just goes empty.

You scramble to pull together disjointed pieces of information that, when previously presented, worked together but now the pieces donâ€™t fit together in the same way.

**Itâ€™s an infurating experience that can be avoided.**

Through practical exercises you can learn to build high quality software that solves unique problems.

Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re here to help you do. -->

## About Handlebar Labs

Since 2017 Handlebar Labs has been teaching developers around the world how to use React Native. Over 5 years, 25,000 students, and millions of visitors to our tutorials and courses weâ€™re expanding outside of just React Native.

Handlebar Labs is [@spencer_carli](https://twitter.com/spencer_carli). I use technology as a tool to build things - to solve problems. Iâ€™ll be honest - **I donâ€™t love web/mobile development. I love what it allows me to build.**

I donâ€™t want to spend a ton of time learning and becoming top 1% in a tool. I want to know enough to accomplish the task well - quickly and confidently.

Handlebar Labs is my contribution to helping other people build things that solve problems with technology.
