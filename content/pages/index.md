  - name: Alkemista
    description: Originally a companion app to the Alkemista Infusion Vessel for spirits. The app evolved into a resource for people to discover, explore, and rank cocktails and alcohol infusions with the goal of expanding to a mini-social network for cocktail aficionados.
    testimonial: Spencer is an amazing, talented and deeply technical developer who helped us transform our vision for creating the single best mobile app for cocktail recipes into reality. With a keen attention-to-detail and an unwavering empathy for the customer, Spencer made even the most complex user tasks breathtakingly simple. He worked side-by-side with our UI/UX designer to build, test and refine the user experience. His full-stack technical development skills allowed us to build our mobile app on a solid foundation for usability, scale and performance. He is also a great guy to work with on a personal level. He responds to issues in a timely manner and works expediently. We plan on using Spencer over the years to come as we refine and expand our mobile strategy.

  - name: Firstline
    description: A mobile app to help hospital networks distribute the latest guidelines from infectious disease staff to the rest of their colleagues. The app also provided a platform for experts from different hospital networks to collaborate and share information.
    testimonial: Spencer has been a contributor to the Firstline mobile product over several years. His work with Firstline has ranged from consulting on strategy and problem solving, through to hands-on development in many of the more sophisticated elements of an incredibly complex clinical product. There is little in the mobile product that he has not had some influence on. Spencer produced consistently high quality code, whether working as part of a team or individually. A sharp mind, a deep technical understanding, and a creative can-do approach to challenges means Spencer is a pleasure to have on the team.

  - name: React Native School
    description: An internal project geared towards teaching developers how to confidently build React Native apps. With over 180 tutorials, 18 courses, and more than 26,500 students React Native School has become a go-to resource for anyone looking to use React Native. All development and content creation has been done in house.
    testimonial: Not only is the course instructor very attentive but it's the first course and community I've been in (and I have been in many), where the instructor walks through every step. The tutorials and guidance given by Spencer are more in depth than anything else you'll find. I truly get the feeling that the goal of teaching is based upon the desire to solve problems and make solutions instead of just create tutorials and make a buck. The experience learned here cannot be replaced and I cannot recommend the content of React Native School enough. If you want to learn and understand, look no further.
